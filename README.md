Description

javascript library with useful functions and extendable by classes

Resume

zdelib is a jquery type library based on selectors and dom object manipulation, it differs on
the intention to provide a minimum class extension for allowing the user to build a very basic framework
based on its capabilities. Some graphics/multimedia functions (maybe htm5) are intended to be added to the
library in the future.
